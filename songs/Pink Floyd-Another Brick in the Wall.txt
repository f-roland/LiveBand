Dm
We don’t need no education
Dm
We don’t need no thoughts controlled
Dm
No dark sarcasm in the class room
Dm                              G
Teacher leave those kids alone…
G                                 Dm
Hey…Teacher leave them kids alone…

#Chorus
F                     C                   Dm
All in all it’s just another brick in the wall
F                       C                   Dm
All in all you’re just another brick in the wall
