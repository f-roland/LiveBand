#Intro]
Am F C F Am F C F Am F C


#Verse 1]
Am      F             C
There's gonna be roses
                          F
And your picture in a frame
C                 G
The women will be crying
        F              G            C
And the men, they will whisper your name

Am       F        C
Umbrellas will be open
                        F
On a hill side of graves
C                    G
The children will be dressed up
        F        G          C
And chase each other in the rain

#Chorus]
            C
And there's gonna be a darkness
      G/B
Maybe colder than you guess
      F
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      G
There may not be angels filling the air
     C
Your mother may be there
     G/B
Your father may be there
      F
There may not be voices
                      G
Sent from a throne to carry you home

#Instrumental]
Am F C F

#Verse 2]
Am     F          C
Oh heaven may not get you
                      F
The devil may see you first
C                 G         F
He's hidden himself in both
       G          C
The beast and the bird
Am       F          C
A stranger may have found you
                                    F
Where the angels have lulled you to sleep
C                G            F
They swallow you whole like a whale
          G            C
From your head to your feet

#Chorus]
            C
And there's gonna be a darkness
      G/B
Maybe colder than you guess
      F
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      G
There may not be angels filling the air

     C
Your mother may be there
     G/B
Your father may be there
      F
There may not be voices
                      G
Sent from a throne to carry you home

#Bridge]
G                        Dm
Well you think there's a place
              G
Wide open and wide
                          Dm
Where you think you'll be safe
                          G
Where you think there's a light

#Chorus]
            C
And there's gonna be a darkness
      G/B
Maybe colder than you guess
      F
There may not be music, there may not be stairs
      G
There may not be angels filling the air

     C
Your mother may be there
     G/B
Your father may be there
      F
There may not be voices
                      G
Sent from a throne to carry you home
