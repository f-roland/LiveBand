C                  G            F                G
Look into my eyes, you will see what you mean to me
            C                  G                 F
Search your heart, search your soul and when you find me there,
F      C         G
you'll search no more
      Dm                     C/E   Dm/F
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
C/E       Dm                     C/E  Dm/F
You can't tell me it's not worth dying for
                  C             G               
You know it's true, everything I do, I do it for you

Look into your heart, you will find, there's nothing there to hide   
             C           G             F                    C    G
Take me as I am, take my life, I would give it all, I would sacrifice
      Dm                     C        Dm  C/D
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
        Dm                       C      Dm
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
                  C             G               C     Csus  C

C       A#           D#                A#               F
There's no love like your love, and no other could give more love
        C               G                     D             G

I can't help it there's nothing I want more
F            C                  G                     F

#Verse
Am7        D
I felt all flushed with fever
G          C
embarrassed by the crowd.
Am7        D
I felt he found my letters
    Em
and read each one out loud.
Am7          D7
I prayed that he would finish
G          B7
but he just kept right on.


#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.


#Verse
Am7        D
He sang as if he knew me
G          C
in all my dark despair.
Am7        D
And then he looked right through me
    Em
as if I wasn't there.
Am7          D7
And he just kept on singing
G          B7
singing clear and strong


#Chorus
 Em                       Am        D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Em                      A                       D        C
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           G               C
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Fmaj7#11           E
Killing me softly,  with his song.
