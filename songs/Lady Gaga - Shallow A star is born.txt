#Intro
Em D G   C D  x2


#Verse
Em         D         G
  Tell me somethin' girl
C                       G       D
  Are you happy in this modern world?
Em         D         G
    Or do you need more
C                              C         D
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?


#Refrain
Em  D   G
I'm fallin'
C               D
In all the good times
                  C  D   G
I find myself longin' for change
C               D
And in the bad times I fear myself


#Verse 2
Em         D         G
Tell me something boy
C                       G       D
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Em         D         G
Or do you need more
C                     C         D
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?


#Refrain
Em   D   G
I'm falling
C
In all the good times
 G       D      Em     D   G
I find myself longing for change
C                       G      D
And in the bad times I fear myself


#Chorus
Am
I'm off the deep end
D
Watch as I dive in
 G          D       Em
I'll never meet the ground
Am
Crash through the surface
D
Where they can't hurt us
       G            D      Em
We're far from the shallow now


#GAGA BUILD UP
Em            Bm                    D            A
oooohhhhh   oahhhhhhh,   oahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


#Chorus
Am
I'm off the deep end
D
Watch as I dive in
 G          D       Em
I'll never meet the ground
Am
Crash through the surface
D
Where they can't hurt us
       G            D      Em
We're far from the shallow now


Am                  D
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low
G             D          Em
In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low
Am                  D
In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low
G             D          Em
We're far from the shallow now
